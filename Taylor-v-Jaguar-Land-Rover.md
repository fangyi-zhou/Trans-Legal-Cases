Case No. 1304471/2018 (Employment Tribunal)

Before: Employment Judge Hughes, Sitting with Mr T.C. Liburd and Mrs R.J. Pelter

## Summary

Non-binary, gender fluid people have the protected characteristics of gender
reassignment under Equality Act 2010.

## The Statute

[Section 7 of Equality Act 2010](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/section/7)
defines the protected characteristic of gender reassignment:

> 7 Gender reassignment
>
> > (1) A person has the protected characteristic of gender reassignment if the
> > person is proposing to undergo, is undergoing or has undergone a process
> > (or part of a process) for the purpose of reassigning the person's sex by
> > changing physiological or other attributes of sex.
> >
> > (2) A reference to a transsexual person is a reference to a person who has
> > the protected characteristic of gender reassignment.
> >
> > (3) In relation to the protected characteristic of gender reassignment—
> >
> > > (a) a reference to a person who has a particular protected characteristic
> > > is a reference to a transsexual person;
> > >
> > > (b) a reference to persons who share a protected characteristic is a
> > > reference to transsexual persons.

## Discussions about Statutory Interpretation

"Proposing to undergo" can be interpreted in multiple ways.
By considering the intention of the Parliament when enacting section 7(1),
the tribunal finds in paragraph 174:

> 174. [...] Be that as it may, in terms of gender-reassignment, the intention
>      was to make it clear that a person need not intend to have surgery, or
>      indeed ever have surgery, in order to identify as a different gender to
>      their birth sex.

The tribunal then turns to Hansard and referred to the remarks made by the
Solicitor General who sponsored the bill through the Parliament.

> 177. We had regard to the following extracts. In Column 168: “It concerns a
>      personal move away from one’s birth sex, into a state of one’s choice… a
>      personal process which may be proposed but never gone through. It may
>      have happened. Its nature may be medical one. It may be choosing to
>      dress in a different way, and moving a gender identity away from birth
>      sex”. In Column 179: “Someone who was driven by a characteristic would
>      be in the process of gender reassignment, however intermittently it
>      manifested itself”.  Column 171: “Gender reassignment, as defined, is a
>      personal process, so there is no question of having something to do
>      something medical, let alone surgical, to fit the definition”. Column
>      172: “Fourthly \[as regards the definition\], someone who has a
>      gender-identity that is different from that expected from a person of
>      their recorded natal sex is covered too. Where is the deficiency in our
>      clause?”. Finally, Column 204: “At what point [proposing to undergo]
>      amounts to “considering undergoing” a gender reassignment is pretty
>      unclear. However, “proposing” suggests a more definite decision point,
>      at which the person’s protected characteristic would immediately come
>      into being. There are lots of ways in which that can be manifested – for
>      instance, by making their intention known. Even if they do not take a
>      single further step, they will be protected straight away.
>      Alternatively, a person might start to dress, or behave, like someone
>      who is changing their gender or is living in an identity of the opposite
>      sex. That too, would mean they were protected. If an employer is
>      notified of that proposal, they will have a clear obligation not to
>      discriminate against them” (our emphasis added).

The tribunal goes on the conclude non-binary, gender fluid or transitioning
people have the protected characteristic of gender reassignment.

> 178. We thought it was very clear that Parliament intended gender
>      reassignment to be a spectrum moving away from birth sex, and that a
>      person could be at any point on that spectrum. That would be so, whether
>      they described themselves as “non-binary” i.e. not at point A or point
>      Z, “gender fluid” i.e. at different places between point A and point Z
>      at different times, or “transitioning” i.e. moving from point A, but not
>      necessarily ending at point Z, where A and Z are biological sex. We
>      concluded that it was beyond any doubt that somebody in the situation of
>      the Claimant was (and is) protected by the legislation because they are
>      on that spectrum and they are on a journey which will not be the same in
>      any two cases. It will end up where it does. The wording of section 7(1)
>      accommodates that interpretation without any violence to the statutory
>      language Consequently, there is jurisdiction to hear the gender
>      reassignment claim.
